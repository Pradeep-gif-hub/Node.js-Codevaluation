// Streams are sequence of data that are moved from one place to another or time to time.

// watching videos on yt 
// data os transferred in CHUNKS or Small Bits/ Packages and gets passed/streamed.


// Buffers- Node.js cant control the pace at which data arrives in the stream;
// it can only decode when is the right time to send the data fro processing 
// if there is data already processed or too little data to process so NODE puts the arriving data in a buffer
