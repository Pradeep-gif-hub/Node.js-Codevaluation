// JS is a Synchronous, Blocking single threaded language

// synchronous- if two functions get called at the same time then the first A executes and then B  ... 
// like in a synchronous fashion 

// Blocking- because of synchronous since blocks the other codes till the first one don't get executed first
// single threaded- one code at one time


// JS is not sufficient, We need new pieces to work with for outside of the javascript
// FOR FRONTED- WEBbrowser APIs - timer,DOM and Promises come sin play
// FOR BACKEND- Node.js comes into the play

// web Browser and Node.js define the functions and APIs that allow us to register functions that 
// should be invoked Asynchronously rather than Synchronously


// Like Eventlistener, Settimeout, set-timeinterval,callbacks, Promises, async awaits, add Eventlistener..

// WE WANT NON BLOCKING ( ASYNCHRONOUS) BEHAVIOR which is made possible by a 
// WEB-BROWSER For FRONTEND and NODE.JS for Backend
