// computer connected to internet behaves as a CLIENT AND SERVER 
// Client which make REQUEST to the Server connected to internet
// Server sends the RESPONSE to the client connected to internet

// IT IS NOT NECESSARY THE FORMAT OR DATATYPE OF RESPONSE IS ALWAYS UNDERSTAnDABLE 
// by the CLient or Server thats where HTTP comes into the play ( Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
// meaning client request as HTTP format and the Response from server is also as HTTP copy format.

// Node.js create a web server using Node.JS
// Node has an event loop to run task asynchronously asn is perfect for creating web services that can simaoltabsly 
// handle large volumes of requests
// the node server we create should still respect the HTTP format
// The HTTP module allows creation of web services that can transfer data over HTTP
