// Sematic Versioning

// SEMVER- is one of the most widely adopted versioning systems
// A simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers 
// are assigned and incremented... 

// it is crucial to keep a semantic ans historical track of changes
// version numbers and the ways they change convey ,enaing abput the underlying code and what had been modifed 
// from one of version to th next

// X.Y.Z --// Major.Minor.Patch

// when u fix a bug adn the code stays backwords compatible u increment the PATCH VERSION  (1.1.1 to 1.1.2)
// when u add new fucntionality and the code still stays backword then u increase the minor  
// also reset the patch to 0 (1.1.1 to 1.2.0)


// when u make changes and the code is no more backwords compitable. u increanet the major one reseting all other
//feature to 0
// from (1.1.1 to 2.0.0);
// sematic version always start from (0.1.0)
